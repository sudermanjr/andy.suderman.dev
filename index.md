## Skills

I began my career as a self-starting engineer who was willing and able to learn
new skills quickly. I am proficient in Bash, Python, Go, Docker and Kubernetes,
as well as a myriad of other technologies. Some of my passions still lie in
running distributed, resilient, secure systems and automating the surrounding
tasks.

Since transitioning into leadership roles, I have learned to take the skills and
rapid understanding of technology that I had as an individual contributor and
translate them into meaningful strategic thinking. While I may no longer be the
most skilled engineer in the room, I understand how the underlying technologies
that we work with affect the decisions that the business is making. Couple this
understanding with high-level thinking and the ability to make meaningful
compromise, and you will find that I am a valuable leader for a highly technical
engineering and/or operations organization.
