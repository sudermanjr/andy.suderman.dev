  <h1>Andy Suderman</h1>
<p>andy@suderman.dev</p>
<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>I began my career as a self-starting engineer who was willing and able to learn new skills quickly. I am proficient in Bash, Python, Go, Docker and Kubernetes, as well as a myriad of other technologies. Some of my passions still lie in running distributed, resilient, secure systems and automating the surrounding tasks.</p>
<p>Since transitioning into leadership roles, I have learned to take the skills and rapid understanding of technology that I had as an individual contributor and translate them into meaningful strategic thinking. While I may no longer be the most skilled engineer in the room, I understand how the underlying technologies that we work with affect the decisions that the business is making.  Couple this understanding with high-level thinking and the ability to make meaningful compromise, and you will find that I am a valuable leader for a highly technical engineering and/or operations organization.</p>
