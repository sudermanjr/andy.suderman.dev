# Andy Suderman

<address class="subheading">andy@suderman.dev</address>

I began my career as a self-taught engineer who was willing and able to learn
new skills quickly. I am proficient in Bash, Python, Go, Docker and Kubernetes,
as well as a myriad of other technologies. My passions include running
distributed, resilient, secure systems and automating the surrounding tasks.

Since transitioning into leadership roles, I have learned to take the skills and
rapid understanding of technology that I had as an individual contributor and
translate them into meaningful strategic thinking. Where I previously sought
simply to be the most skilled engineer possible, I now understand how the
underlying technologies that we work with affect the decisions that the business
is making. Couple this understanding with high-level thinking and the ability to
make meaningful compromise, and you will find that I am a valuable leader for a
highly technical engineering and/or operations organization.
